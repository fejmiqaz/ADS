# Algorithms and Data structures with Java

<p>In this repository you will find multiple algorithms and data structures tasks solved while learning and understanding how they work, and that will prepare me for the midterms/exams for this subject.
There can be unsolved tasks that I haven't been able to finish, or didn't have the time to; feel free to contact me if you know the solutions to them and for better algorithms of the specific ones that I have done.
